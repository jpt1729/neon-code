# Astro Score Tracker

A neon display that tracks the astros score in real time!

Based off of [this tutorial.](https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-matrices-matrix-panels-with-circuitpython/example-simple-two-line-text-scroller) 

Right now the demo isn't live tracking a game, but it will when baseball season is back in. Some code like game updates will be done when it is baseball season but the function works I just don't know how the api will look when game updates happen.
